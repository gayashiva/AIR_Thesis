Irrigated agriculture is crucial for the livelihood security of mountain communities. Using meltwater from
glaciers, snow and permafrost, mountain dwellers have developed sophisticated techniques to cope with recurrent
water scarcity caused by glacial retreat, and seasonal snow-cover dynamics. Artificial ice
reservoirs (AIRs) are a key example of community based water management. Worldwide, farmers in around 30 mountain
villages build these ice structures. These seasonal ice reservoirs increase meltwater availability during the
critical period of water scarcity. To assess the role of AIRs within the water resource management of
mountain villages under a changing climate, they need to be represented in integrated modelling frameworks.
Efficient water storage can be achieved by taking into account their local meteorological conditions and
water availability throughout the year. This thesis aims to examine the volume evolution of AIRs within the
framework of a mass and energy balance model, as well as developing construction strategies that can enhance
their size and duration while increasing their water-use efficiency.

We estimate the different contributions of AIR surface processes built in Switzerland and
Ladakh. These two regions exhibit different meteorological patterns due to their significant latitudinal
and altitudinal differences. Using an AIR-specific mass and energy balance model which keeps into account
meteorological factors, fountain discharge and ice volume changes, surface processes are quantified and compared
across the two locations. The results reveal that higher sublimation process enhanced the Indian AIRs freezing
rate, and poor fountain operation of both the AIRs resulted in wastage of four-fifth of the provided water supply.
These results highlight the relevance of colder, drier climates and fountain water supply
management in optimizing AIR construction.

Then, we attempt water loss reduction of AIRs on the Swiss Alps by implementing
fountain scheduling strategies. Fountain scheduling was realized through a control valve that was automated with
optimal discharge rates computed using real-time weather input and location metadata. Simulations converting
unscheduled fountains to scheduled fountains showed a more than threefold improvement in the water use
efficiency of several AIRs. Fountain operation using scheduling strategies produced similar ice volumes while
consuming one-tenth of the water compared to their unscheduled counterparts.  Overall, these results show that
automated fountain water supply management can both increase the water use efficiency of AIRs and reduce their
maintenance needs without compromising on their meltwater production.

This thesis advances, for the first time, a model and measurement based understanding on the volume evolution of AIRs under different climates. It
provides tools to quantify the storage potential of these ice structures worldwide and practical strategies to
improve their efficacy. This study improves the scientific evidence needed to upscale this indigenous water
storage technology. Our findings are essential to design these nature-based solutions that increase the
reliability of water supply in highly seasonal and arid environments and improve water security and climate
change adaptation in mountain regions. Future work may build on this research by fully integrating climate
change scenarios to investigate the potential hydrological contributions of ice harvesting technologies for
water-stressed mountain catchments.
