Irrigated agriculture is crucial for the livelihood security of mountain communities. Using meltwater from
glaciers, snow and permafrost, mountain dwellers have developed sophisticated techniques to cope with recurrent
water scarcity caused by glacial retreat and seasonal snow-cover dynamics. Artificial ice reservoirs (AIRs) are
a key example of community-based water management. Worldwide, farmers in around 30 mountain villages build these
ice structures. These seasonal ice reservoirs increase meltwater availability during the critical period of
water scarcity. To assess the role of AIRs within the water resource management of mountain villages under a
changing climate, they need to be represented in integrated modelling frameworks. Efficient water storage can be
achieved by taking into account their local meteorological conditions and water availability throughout the
year. This thesis aims to increase the understanding of volume dynamics of AIRs to provide tools to reduce their
water losses and maintenance requirements.

The different contributions of surface processes of the AIRs built in Guttannen, Switzerland and  Gangles, India
were estimated. These two locations present different meteorological patterns due to their significant
latitudinal and altitudinal differences. Using AIR-specific mass and energy balance models that consider
meteorological factors, fountain discharge, and ice volume changes, surface processes were quantified and
compared across the two locations. The models successfully estimated the observed ice volume evolution with a
root mean square error within 20\% of the maximum ice volume for five AIRs. The location in Ladakh presented a
maximum ice volume four times larger than that of the Guttannen site. However, poor fountain operation resulted
in wastage of more than four fifths of the provided water supply. These results highlight the relevance of
colder drier climates and fountain water supply management in the optimization of AIR construction.

In addition, AIR water loss reduction was attempted on the Swiss Alps by implementing fountain scheduling
strategies. Fountain scheduling was performed using a ball valve automated with optimal discharge rates computed
using customized glacial models. Simulations converting nonscheduled fountains into scheduled fountains showed a
more than threefold improvement in the water use efficiency of several AIRs. Fountain operation using scheduling
strategies produced similar ice volumes while consuming one tenth of the water compared with their nonscheduled
counterparts. Overall, these results show that automated fountain water supply management can both increase the
water-use efficiency of AIRs and reduce their maintenance needs without compromising their meltwater production.

This thesis introduces, for the first time, a model- and measurement-based understanding on the volume evolution
of AIRs under different climates; it also presents methods to quantify the storage potential of these ice
structures worldwide and practical tools to improve their efficacy. This study improves the scientific evidence
needed to upscale this indigenous water storage technology. These findings are essential to design these
nature-based solutions that increase the reliability of water supply in highly seasonal and arid environments
and improve water security and climate change adaptation in mountain regions. Future work may build on this
research by fully integrating climate change scenarios to investigate the potential hydrological contributions
of ice harvesting technologies for water-stressed mountain catchments.
