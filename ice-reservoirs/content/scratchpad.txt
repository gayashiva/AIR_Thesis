% Global climate change is accelerating glacial ablation in many mountain regions of the world, generating
% concerns about the impact on local and regional water resources \citep{}. 
% Sources of freshwater from mountains, such as rainfall, snow and glacier melt, and groundwater are strongly
% affected by climate change, leading to important changes in water supply in terms of quantity and timing (e.g.
% shifts and changes in seasonality).

% Irrigation networks in arid mountain regions are completely dependent on the timely availability of meltwater
% from glaciers, snow and permafrost
% \citep{immerzeelImportanceVulnerabilityWorld2020,farhanHydrologicalRegimesConjunction2015,tveitenGlacierGrowingLocal2007}.
% With the accelerated decline of glaciers due to climate change \citep{nusserLocalKnowledgeGlobal2016}, these
% regions are experiencing acute water scarcity \citep{norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015,
% mukhopadhyayReevaluationSnowmeltGlacial2015}. Further, the unreliability and the foreseen decrease of seasonal
% snow cover \citep{chevuturiClimateChangeLeh2018} affects the cryosphere's ability to store water, especially in
% spring.

% More than 700 million people live in mountain areas, of these, around 300 million are vulnerable to food
% insecurity \citep{messerliMountainsWorldVulnerable2004}.

% Even the choice of the glacier grafting site suggests that the technique was developed as aÂ result of
% the residents' deep understanding of local environmental processes.

% Our findings are essential to design nature-based solutions that increase the reliability of water supply in
% highly seasonal and arid environments and improve water security and climate change adaptation in mountain
% regions.

% Irrigation networks in arid mountain regions are completely dependant on the timely availability of meltwater
% from glaciers, snow and permafrost. With the accelerated decline of glaciers, these irrigation networks can no
% longer deliver adequate water to sustain agricultural output and take advantage of the complete growing season.
% As a consequence, some mountain villages have either been abandoned or lie on the brink of desertification
% \citep{grossmanHimalayanGlaciersMelt2015}.

% In response, we conducted measurement campaigns using drones, flowmeters and weather stations on almost a dozen
% AIRs across two locations (India and Switzerland), over four winters (2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022) and using two
% different construction methods (traditional and automated). Each dataset contained information on the
% meteorological conditions, fountain characteristics and AIR volume evolution.

% The primary objective of this thesis was to improve our understanding of AIRs' response to changes in
% their construction location. The secondary objective was to propose automated construction strategies that reduce
% water losses and maintenance efforts.

% In paper I, an AIR model was designed to resolve surface processes and used to compare their volume evolution in
% Indian Himalayas and the Swiss Alps. In paper II, the evolution of AIRs using different fountain scheduling
% strategies were compared. In paper III, the possibility of sustaining artificial ice reservoirs perpetually was
% explored. The methodology presented in this thesis accounts for variations in a location's meteorology and AIR
% construction design. Although the approach is demonstrated on specific locations using fountain pipeline
% systems, it can be extended to account for different construction strategies used in other locations. The
% results of these papers can be summarised as follows:

its radius, area and volume using DEMs produced from drone flights. The fountain characteristics were calibrated
from the observed radius and discharge rates. The model parameters were calibrated from some volume
observations. The rest of this DEM dataset were used to validate the modelled volume evolution.  

The corresponding datasets were categorised based on the prefix of the country and the suffix of the winter
season (eg. CH21 AIRs ).

These structures were built on south-facing slopes as a cascading series of rock walls in the river beds to
reduce runoff velocity and guide meltwater into shadowed areas . The resulting
shallow pools begin to freeze as temperatures drop in winter, and ice accumulates. 

A spirit of improvisation guides the design and construction of AIRs making it difficult to make a quantitative
comparison from site to site.  A holistic approach is required which uses the topographical conditions and water
demands of the construction site to choose the appropriate construction methodology and form of ice reservoir to
be produced.

There are also villages that still rely
on ice terraces for their water supply. [Other
publications](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-018-1372-0/tables/1) estimate that these
alternative construction strategies can store **30 times** more water than ice stupas. However, none of these
alternative construction strategies have been explored to date. Moreover, these alternative strategies remain
unoptimised further limiting their true potential.   

It requires an understanding of the
response of these AIRs both to meteorological conditions and construction strategies used.

\subsection{Minimum requirements}

Our results have shown that Swiss AIRs cannot function as water reservoirs due to their small size and short
survival duration. Therefore, construction of AIRs should not be carried out in locations with meteorological
conditions less favourable than the Swiss site.

It is not straightforward to compare the meteorological conditions between two sites. A proper comparison
requires the complete set of meteorological variables described in Section ?. In order to circumvent this, we
introduce a new metric that serves as an indicator of the water storage potential of any new site.

However, one indicator of the AIR water storage potential of any new site is the number of subzero hours
annually weighted by 

Another way to locate favourable regions is through occurence of aufeis fields

Naturally occuring aufeis fields and glaciers serve as a good indicator of where ice reservoirs can be made.

However, the topography requirements are sensitive to the form of AIRs used. The ice stupa form of AIRs are less
sensitive to solar radiation and therefore can exist in lower altitudes and non-shadowed zones compared to the
ice terrace form of AIRs. 

It is pointless to use lakes as water sources unless there is utility in draining and converting them to ice
structures. This is the case for glacial lakes which can be drained to prevent flash floods while using the
water supply to harvest ice structures.

AIRs are thus an important tool for water resource management particularly of cryosphere-fed irrigation systems.
However, their long-term efficacy and their usefulness as climate change adaptation strategies remains unknown
\citep{clouseLadakhArtificialGlaciers2017}. Therefore, quantifications of their water storage need to account
for the meteorological conditions present and construction methodologies used during AIR construction.

While much has been written about the promise of AIRs for irrigation water supply, very little data exists to
support these claims. 

We attempt to address this gap through a measurement campaign of AIRs built in India and Switzerland. This
campaign used drones, flowmeters and weather stations to create a calibration and validation dataset for a mass
and energy balance model. 

The influence of meteorological conditions on AIR water-use efficiency and maximum volume was quantified by
comparing the modelled volume evolution of Indian AIRs and Swiss AIRs.

The influence of the fountain characteristics on AIR water-use efficiency and maximum volume was quantified by
comparing the modelled volume evolution of AIRs produced with different fountain designs and scheduling
strategies.

AIR serve to bridge this gap in water availability by providing meltwater earlier in the agricultural season.
AIRs do so by exploiting gravity and freezing winter temperatures to amass a seasonal stock of ice. Many types
of AIRs exist. In the past these were built as horizontal ice sheets much higher up the mountains, making them
difficult to manage. Now, as ice cones, they are built next to where the water is needed most, right on the
outskirts of villages, near their fields.

Due to low temperatures and high variability of seasonal snow cover
\citep{mukhopadhyayReevaluationSnowmeltGlacial2015}, there is a shortage of water at the onset of the
agricultural season for about two months until a sufficient and reliable supply of meltwater from high altitude
glaciers becomes available. 

For centuries, in the Himalayan mountain ranges, local cultures have believed that glaciers are alive. And
whatâs more, that certain glaciers can have different genders including male and female. These people âbreedâ
new glaciers by grafting togetherâor marryingâfragments of ice from male and female glaciers, then covering them
with charcoal, wheat husks, cloths, or willow branches so they can reproduce in privacy. These glacierets
transform into fully active glaciers that grow each year with additional snowfall. Those then serve as lasting
reserves of water that farmers can use to irrigate their crops. Over the years, these practices have inspired
other cultures, where people are creating their own artificial ice reservoirs (AIRs) and applying them to solve
serious modern challenges around water supplies.

Take Ladakh, a high-altitude desert region in northern India. It sits in the rain shadow of the Himalayas and
receives on average fewer than ten centimeters of rain/snow per year. As local glaciers shrink because of
climate change, regional water scarcity is increasing. And so, local farmers have started growing their own ice
reservoirs as insurance against this uncertainty. 

The compilation of these novel and comprehensive data sets and main results about the meteorological influences
are described and discussed in Paper II.

One approach to determine the freezing energy balance of this location could be used as a metric to define where
AIRs have utility as a water storage technology.

AIRs are engineered systems exploiting gravity and freezing winter temperatures to amass a seasonal stock of
ice. 

These AIRs are constructed as close to the villages as possible. Being at a lower altitude than the natural
glaciers, AIRS begin melting in April, providing irrigation just in time for the start of the agricultural
season.

Recent research has called for an examination of their long-term efficacy and their usefulness as climate change
adaptation strategies \citep{clouseLadakhArtificialGlaciers2017}. 

A spirit of improvisation guides the design and construction of AIRs making it difficult to make a quantitative
comparison from site to site.

The construction of ice terraces on south-facing slopes is regarded not only as a way to cope with water
scarcity but also as an adaptation to climate change \citep{norphelArtificialGlacierHigh2009}.

AIRs are engineered systems exploiting gravity and freezing winter temperatures to amass a seasonal stock of
ice.

Adequate crop production assumes a central role in the lives of mountain farmers, making the availability of
irrigation water indispensable. The chief components of that resource are meltwater from glaciers and seasonal
snow cover. However, seasonal melting of glaciers occurs quite late because of the regions's high altitude,
which delays the availability of glacial meltwater. This seasonal water scarcity makes it essential to provide
supplementary irrigation in order to take advantage of the complete growing season. 

Modelling is a powerful tool that allows to identify the causes of AIR volume dynamics in space and time.
However, in-situ observations are required to tie these models to reality.  

In this thesis a one dimensional model has been developed which is used as a tool to investigate the dynamics of
AIRs.

The ice volume dynamics due to the difference in weather patterns of the Swiss location and Indian
location can be summarised as follows: 

 It is not known who started the practice of glacier grafting, but according to oral history it is as old as the
local communities.

% Finally, the scripts developed are also shared and could be adapted in various contexts to
% efficiently calculate ice surface processes over arbitrary complex and/or large geometries, including in
% non-mountain applications; a further benefit of the âOpen Scienceâ approach taken.

% \section{Final thoughts}

% Progressing glacier melt and the associated growing number of lakes rises the threat of glacier lake outburst
% floods (GLOFs); at the same time declining melt water supply changes the hydological regime, resulting in
% changing water availability especially during dry seasons. AIRs could become a crucial water resource management
% strategy to deal with both these high and low flow water hazards.

% With suitable technological development, GLOF risk can be mitigated through artificial glaciers.

% Successfully creating such an artificial glacier could provide unprecedented scientific insights in the
% processes governing glacial formation. More importantly, they could be used to harvest glacial lakes into ice
% reservoirs and pave the way for scalable climate adaptation strategies.

% The model has been shown to perform excellently when calibrated with the AIR datasets.  It could be shown that
% the maximum volume of AIRs located in the IN and CH regions differ by an order of magnitude. These differences
% were caused by the stronger sublimation process due to the colder and drier weather conditions of the IN region. 

% AIR maintenance requirement was reduced and their fountain freezing events were prevented by developing an
% automated construction strategy. Fountain operation was made 8 times more efficient and effortless through the
% use of an automation system that scheduled discharge rates based on the recommendations of the AIR model. 

% For example, the catchment of Chicon, Peru has a current glacier coverage of more than 6 \%. In general, the
% runoff in Chicon is low, barely exceeding 1.2 $m^3/s$ even during the wet season. Runoff during the dry months
% is very low and goes down to only 0.2 $m^3/s$ \cite{motschmannIntegratedAssessmentsWater2020}. The glacier
% meltwater contribution is comparatively low but still has an important impact. The situation potentially worsens
% in the future, where the runoff in the high emission scenorio is constantly below 1 $m^3/s$ and goes down to 0.1
% $m^3/s$.

% \section{Quantification of the adaptation potential of Stok catchment}\label{sec:adaptation}

% Stok catchment in Ladakh is fed by a glacier with area of 0.8 $km^2$ (1969) and has a dry season melt rate of
% 0.25 $mm/day$ \cite{sohebMassbalanceObservationReconstruction2020}. This implies the village receives around
% 0.002 $m^3/s$ of glacial meltwater supply during April and May. Icestupa meltwater quantities measured in nearby
% villages supply more than 10 $m^3/day$ (Fig.\ref{fig:ISmelt}) or about 10 percent of Stok's glacial water supply.
% Therefore, to adapt against 8 \% reduction in glacial meltwater supply only 1 ice stupa is required.
