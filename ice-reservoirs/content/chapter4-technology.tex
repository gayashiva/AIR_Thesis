  long distances and to keep water flowing in cold temperatures.}{Marcus Nüsser}{(Professor, South Asia Institute)}

There is a long tradition of developing water harvesting structures in the upper Indus Basin, in both Ladakh,
northern India \citep{labbalTraditionalOasesLadakh2000, nusserIrrigationDevelopmentUpper2012} and various
locations in northern Pakistan \citep{kreutzmannScarcityOpulenceWater2011}. This is because land use in these
cold arid regions have always been prone to seasonal water scarcity, affecting irrigation and domestic water
supply \citep{dameSTONGDEREVISITEDLANDUSE2010, nusserLocalKnowledgeGlobal2016}. However, irrigated agriculture
continues to be a major, albeit declining, source of livelihood and food security in these regions
\cite{dameFoodSecurityHigh2011}. 

Due to the short growing period, central Ladakh is a single-cropping area with barley and wheat as important
staples, complemented by vegetables, pulses, and oil seeds. Depending on altitudinal position, irrigation with
complete flooding of fields (approximately 2-5 cm water column) starts between March and April prior to the
melting of high-altitude glaciers \citep{nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}. Further, the unreliability
and the foreseen decrease of seasonal snow cover \citep{chevuturiClimateChangeLeh2018} increase the precariousness of the water
storage function of the cryosphere, especially in spring. In order to cope with recurrent water scarcity, many
water harvesting technologies and community arrangements have been developed
\citep{nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019} (see Fig. \ref{fig:AIRdesigns}). 

In this chapter, we focus on the ice stupa form of AIRs and provide construction strategies to reduce their
water-use efficiency, maximum ice volume and maintenance effort

Ice stupas were invented by Sonam Wangchuk in 2013 \cite{wangchukIceStupaArtificial2014} to provide a much
cheaper alternative to achieve water storage compared to ice terraces. Ice stupas can also be placed much closer
to the plantations since they absorb lesser solar radiation per unit volume compared to ice terraces due to
their conical shape. However, the typical volume range of ice stupas (see Fig. \ref{fig:airs_ladakh}) are also
much smaller than ice terraces. Over the past decade, several ice stupas have been built to supplement
irrigation water supply of mountain villages in India \citep{wangchukIceStupaCompetition2020,
palmerStoringFrozenWater2022, aggarwalAdaptationClimateChange2021}, Kyrgyzstan
\citep{bbcnewsBrightArtificialGlacier2020} and Chile \citep{reutersConservationistsChileAim2021}. 

\subsection{Construction strategy and its limitations}

\begin{figure}[htb]

\label{fig:ISconstruction}
\end{figure}

A typical AIR (see Fig. \ref{fig:ISexample}) simply requires a fountain nozzle mounted on a supply pipeline. The
water source is usually a glacial stream. Due to the altitude difference between the pipeline input and fountain
output, water ejects from the fountain nozzle as droplets which freeze under subzero winter conditions. The
fountain is manually activated during winter nights. The fountain nozzle is raised through the addition of metal
pipes when significant ice accumulates below (see Fig. \ref{fig:ISconstruction}).  Typically, a dome of branches
is constructed around the metal pipes so that pipe extensions can be done from within this dome. Threads, tree
branches and fishing nets are used to guide and accelerate the ice formation.

One of the common problems with AIR construction systems is related to fountain scheduling. Fountain scheduling
is simply answering the questions of “When do we spray?”, “How much do we spray?” and “How long do we spray?”.
Starting a fountain spray too early, spraying too much water or running a fountain spray too long might lead to
overwatering. At the very least, this practice wastes water.  Similarly, starting the fountain spray too late,
spraying too little water or not running the system long enough might lead to underwatering and can cause
reduced ice volumes.

Paper I has shown that traditional construction systems suffer from overwatering. In order to avoid this issue,
it is important to understand surface freezing rates, which can be calculated by means of the full energy
balance model developed in the previous chapter. This model requires an accurate estimation of fountain spray
radius to produce recommended discharge rates. In theory, such an estimation is possible by modelling the
projectile motion of water droplets using fountain characteristics like aperture diameter, and discharge rate.
However, in practice, this estimation also depends on the relative importance of wind-driven redistribution
effects in determining the fountain spray radius. Therefore, estimating the fountain spray radius requires a
better understanding of the relative contribution of these two processes.

There are some practical issues that need to be addressed before dealing with the fountain scheduling processes.
For example, in the case of the Indian AIR, the fountain discharge rate could have been halved since they were
always two times higher than the modelled freezing rate (paper I). However, in practice, reduction of discharge
rate could increase the maintenance cost due to higher risk of freezing events in the fountain pipeline.

An optimum construction strategy, therefore, should first prevent the occurrence of freezing events in the
fountain pipeline. These events can be prevented by setting a minimum threshold for the recommended discharge
rate. Additionally, recommended discharge rate needs to be sensitive to constraints on the water supply or
weather of the construction site. For example, locations limited by their water supply like Ladakh, India
would prioritize water use efficiency whereas those limited by the duration of their favourable weather windows
like Guttannen, Switzerland would prioritize maximum ice volume. Accordingly, we use two types of model
parameter optimizations that prevent underwatering and overwatering to attain higher ice volumes and higher
water use efficiency respectively.

However, manually adjusting the fountain discharge rate is not practical due to two reasons- Firstly, this would
involve constant adjustments of discharge rates in response to the significant diurnal and seasonal variations
of the freezing rates. Secondly, frequent pipeline water drainage is required to avoid water losses. Therefore,
operation of scheduled fountains via automation systems is preferred to reduce the long-term maintenance costs.

% In this chapter, we study the performance of two AIRs produced with and without the use of automated fountain
% scheduling strategies but exposed to identical meteorological conditions. The specific objectives of this study
% are to compare the water-use efficiency, maximum ice volume and maintenance effort between these two
% construction strategies.

% Then, we discuss how existing construction strategies for the ice terrace and ice stupa form of AIRs can be improved. Through an analysis
% of their application in Ladakh, we also compare their water storage and cost. Then, we propose new strategies
% through which their water loss, maintenance effort and cost can be reduced.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Comparison of AIR construction strategies}

Table \ref{tab:mb} shows how the two different fountain scheduling strategies influence the mass and energy balance
of the respective AIR.  The overall impact of the radiation fluxes (long-wave and short-wave) and the
turbulent fluxes (sensible and latent) on the freezing and melting energies is determined from their 
energy turnover. The energy turnover is calculated as the sum of energy fluxes in absolute values (see Table
\ref{tab:mb}). 

Fountain scheduling reduced the fountain discharge input and fountain wastewater output by an order of
magnitude. However, this is not resulting in an appreciable difference in the volume evolution of the automated
and traditional AIRs as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:simvsreal}. This is due to two counteracting surface processes
during fountain spray: (a) dampening of albedo to ice albedo and (b) absorption of the heat energy of the
fountain water droplets. The temporal variation of the magnitude of these processes are shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:dis_processes}.

There is a considerable difference in the contribution of the shortwave radiation due to the effect of process
(a). Even though the unscheduled fountain was active for a much longer duration, the frequent snowfall events
counteracted the albedo feedback of its fountain discharge. In contrast, the albedo of the automated AIR was
reduced by late fountain spray events particularly in the months of March and April as shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:dis_processes}. These poorly timed fountain spray events occurred because the global solar radiation
diurnal variation of the automation system is calibrated based on values for the month of February. Therefore,
poor calibration of the automation system resulted in an increased impact of shortwave radiation on the
automated AIR. Similarly, the fountain discharge heat flux for the traditional AIR was enhanced due to process
(b). The higher discharge quantity of the unscheduled fountains and its longer duration were responsible for the
higher contribution of fountain discharge heat flux in the overall energy turnover. Therefore, higher melt of
the automated AIR due to process (a) counteracted the higher melt of the traditional AIR due to process (b).

\section{Ice terraces}

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Ice terrace of Phuktse, viewpoint 4430 m. (a) February 2014 (b) October 2014 Adapted from: \cite{nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}}

\label{fig:ITexample}
\end{figure}

According to oral history and Corona imagery from 1969, the first ice terraces are older than 50 years and can
be found in Phuktse and Igoo. Over the past 30 years, 14 ice terraces have been constructed in central Ladakh,
located in tributary valleys of the Indus \citep{norphelArtificialGlacierHigh2009,
nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}. Chewang Norphel, a well known engineer of the Leh Nutrition
Project, introduced this practice to Ladakh \citep{vinceGlacierMan2009}.  In February 2014, Phuktse built a
successful cascade with an almost continuous stretch of ice (Fig. \ref{fig:ITexample}). 

\subsection{Construction strategy}

There are two distinct types of ice terraces with site-specific modifications as shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:AIRdesigns}: the first type is built as cascades on perennial streams. A series of loose rock walls in
the river bed reduces flow velocity, but still lets water pass through. Such cascades allow flowing water to
freeze on exposed surfaces and form superimposed ice layers when temperatures drop (see Fig.
\ref{fig:ITscience}). 

The second type diverts water from streams with higher flow velocity to small side valleys, shaded by
surrounding mountains. This design allows to integrate higher slope positions for additional ice formation. It
consists of a series of partially cemented stone walls across the stream bed. Their dimensions are adjusted
based on the valley topography. The water for the ice terrace is obtained through a long diversion channel. 

\begin{figure}[htb]

\caption{ The process of ice accumulation for ice terraces Adapted from:
\cite{nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}}

\label{fig:ITscience}
\end{figure}

As mentioned in the previous chapter, the design of the ice terraces is dependent on the suitability of the
site. Furthermore, the following construction guidelines are used depending on the terrain of the site
\cite{norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015}:

\begin{itemize}

  \item If the section of the stream is very wide with a mild slope, then the stone walls are
    constructed in a series parallel to each other. The number and dimension of ice retaining walls depend on
    the flow of water available in the main stream during peak winter. In November, when winter begins, some
    locally available wild grass is put on the base of the dry bund to plug any holes.

  \item If the section of the stream is narrow with a steep grade then it needs to be diverted to a shady area
    by constructing a gravitational channel with a slope of 1:30. When it reaches the ice terrace site the slope
    should be gradually reduced to 1:50, allowing it to flow through small outlets to accelerate freezing. Stone
    walls need to be constructed parallel to the channel in series at a distance of 10-30 m, accoring to the
    natural slope of terrain. The steeper the terrain, the smaller the distance and slope between the bunds.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Water storage and cost}

Ice volume variations of different ice terraces within Ladakh \citep{nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019,
norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015} range from 510 $m^3$ to 81,040 $m^3$ highlighting the importance of local topography and
microclimate in their formation. The cost of construction depends on the size and number of stone walls
required. The estimated cost of ice terraces vary between 4600 to 15,330 USD
\cite{nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}. The location requirements and the construction cost of ice
terraces, therefore, were prohibitive for widespread adoption.

ice stupas in their water resource management strategy.

\caption{Daily meltwater measurements for the IN17 and IN18 AIRs along with the corresponding model estimations
for the IN21 AIR. }

\label{fig:ISmelt}
\end{figure}

The cost of construction primarily depends on the material, size and length of the pipeline required. The
fountain nozzle cost is negligible in comparison. Typical pipeline configuration in Ladakh consists of a high
density polyethylene pipeline of 60 mm diameter and upto 5 km in length and 60 m of head. The estimated cost
of ice stupas vary between USD.

Fig. \ref{fig:ISmelt} shows the temporal variation of daily meltwater quantities obtained from 3 different AIRs
built in Ladakh during their melting periods (mid-April to mid-June). IN17 and IN18 AIRs were constructed in
Phyang village and their meltwater quantities was measured manually using the storage tank shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:ISirrigation}. The details of this measurement strategy are presented in Appendix. IN21 was constructed
in Gangles village and its meltwater quantities were modelled. The differences between the AIRs reflect the
corresponding interannual variability in the weather conditions. The average median daily AIR meltwater
quantities during these 3 melting seasons was around 12 million litres.    

\subsection{Suggested improvement of construction tools}

\subsubsection{Pipeline configuration}

The typical pipeline configuration in Ladakh is prone to pipeline freezing events. Therefore, the pipeline
material with higher insulation properties and diameter is required to lower this risk. Further effort is needed
to find a cost effective way to achieve an ideal pipeline configuration.

\subsubsection{Fountain nozzle}

Even though several AIR fountain nozzles exist, there does not exist a strategy to choose the best among them.
Their efficacy is expected to increase with lower droplet sizes, higher flight times and higher spray radius.
Therefore, a comparative study of all the AIR fountain nozzles used across these four factors would help make an
informed choice for future AIR constructions.

\subsubsection{Water supply management}

All the studied AIRs suffer from overwatering (paper I). Automated fountain water supply management has been
shown to increase their water use efficiency of AIRs and reduce their maintenance without compromising on their
meltwater production. The methodology to implement this new construction strategy is presented in paper II.
