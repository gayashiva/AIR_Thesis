This chapter provides conclusions based on research findings from data collected on AIRs in Switzerland and
India, as well as discussion. This chapter will review the purpose of the study, research questions, literature
review, and findings of the study. It will then present conclusions, discussion of the conclusions, and
recommendations for further research.

\section{Summary}

Mountain regions have always been affected by either too much or too little water. Because of climate change,
hazards are changing rapidly and becoming even more unpredictable \citep{ipccCrossChapterPaperMountains2022}. In
the context of the observed present and predicted global glacier shrinkage, the development of such water
storage technologies is crucial to ensure continued sustenance of cryosphere-fed irrigation networks.

People in mountains have a history of developing skills to live in a dangerous and dynamic environment, which
will be invaluable to learn from for future adaptation and mitigation measures. One such technnology developed
by communities in Ladakh are \ac{AIRs}. These strategies involve augmenting their glacial ice reservoirs with
man-made ones that provide supplementary irrigation during the spring. 

While these technologies have gained renewed attention as a potential strategy to increase water security,
limited scientific evidence exists about their potential hydrological contributions. AIR observations and
investigations date back to the mid-2000s \citep{tveitenGlacierGrowingLocal2007}. The vast majority have been
published in the 2010s, mostly using qualitative methods. However, quantifications of their storage capacity
differ widely amongst these publications \citep{baglaArtificialGlaciersHelp1998, norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015,
nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}. Because small-scale processes, complex feedbacks and
non-linearities govern their evolution, modelling the volume evolution of ice stupas is only feasible if backed
up with comprehensive input, calibration and validation datasets.

\end{figure}


In response, we conducted measurement campaigns using drones, flowmeters and weather stations on almost a dozen
AIRs across two locations (India and Switzerland), over four winters (2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022) and using two
different construction methods (traditional and automated). Each dataset contained information on the
meteorological conditions, fountain characteristics and AIR volume evolution. 

The primary objective of this thesis was to improve our understanding of AIRs' response to changes in
their construction location. The secondary objective was to propose automated construction strategies that reduce
water losses and maintenance efforts. 

\section{Conclusions}

In paper I, an AIR model was designed to resolve surface processes and used to compare their volume evolution in
Indian Himalayas and the Swiss Alps. In paper II, the evolution of AIRs using different fountain scheduling
strategies were compared. In paper III, the possibility of sustaining artificial ice reservoirs perpetually was
explored. The methodology presented in this thesis accounts for variations in a location's meteorology and AIR
construction design. Although the approach is demonstrated on specific locations using fountain pipeline
systems, it can be extended to account for different construction strategies used in other locations. The
results of these papers can be summarised as follows:

\begin{enumerate} 

\item Volumes of ice stupas located in different regions may differ by an order of magnitude. The differences
  could be attributed to the accelerated sublimation process in colder and drier regions.

\item Water losses of ice stupas may be upto 80 \% due to excessive water input. However, water supply
  management through fountain scheduling strategies can produce ice stupas of similar volumes while reducing up to
  one-tenth of their water supply.

\item Traditional construction systems demand significant maintenance efforts since they are prone to freezing
  events in the fountain pipeline. However, automated construction systems can prevent these events to make the
  construction process maintenance-free.

\item There exist locations with favourable meteorological conditions that can sustain artificial ice reservoirs
  perpetually.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Discussion}

\subsection{The state of ice stupa technology}

The thesis shows one strategy that can improve the water-use efficiency of AIRs. We chose this strategy because
it enables the use of the AIR model in a simple and effective manner. But all these construction strategies are
limited by the tools they use, namely the fountain and the pipeline. The fountain nozzle design is crucial for
increasing the ice volume obtained. However, no methodology currently exists to rank the several fountain
nozzles used for construction. An ideal pipeline configuration could make this technology cheaper and
maintenance free. However, optimization of the pipeline material and diameters is yet to be performed---despite
the time lost on pipeline freezing events and the potential cost reduction with cheaper pipeline materials and
sizes. Therefore, we strongly encourage the engineering community to get involved and push the limits of the
cost-effectiveness, size, and survival duration of artificial ice reservoirs. 

\subsection{Adaptation potential of glacierized catchments with AIRs}

Vanishing glaciers, natural hazards (like inundations, mudflows, and landslides), decreasing river discharge,
drying springs, next to shifts in precipitation patterns are apparent climate change impacts which affect
glacierized catchments.

In the Peruvian Andes, both water scarcity (low-flow water risk) and glacial lake outburst floods (high flow
water risks) could have important impacts on local population, infrastructure and economic activities
\citep{motschmannIntegratedAssessmentsWater2020}. For example, the estimated loss in annual wheat output due to
reduced glacial runoff would be to the tune of 18 million USD even in the low emission scenario of Quillcay catchment
of Peru \citep{motschmannLossesDamagesConnected2020}. Similarly, in the Stok catchment of Ladakh, glacial ice
reserves have shrunk by more than 18 \% in the past 16 years, leading to a decline in crop productivity
\citep{sohebSpatiotemporalQuantificationKey2022}. 

We believe AIRs can already buffer against low flow water risks in certain catchments. For example, ice
terraces in nearby valleys have been measured with areas up to 19 \% of the Stok glacier (0.8 $km^2$). With further technology
development, AIRs can also be used to mitigate high flow water risks. The glacial lakes of the Andes and
Himalayas can be siphoned to form AIRs in scale that last perpetually. Such AIRs can compound over the years to
become another source of perennial water supply for the respective catchments.

\section{Future research direction}

Any future research can take advantage of the meteorological, fountain and drone datasets acquired in the two field
sites described in this thesis. Both AIR and COSISTUPA models are also freely provided through git repositories
for non-profit purposes (https://github.com/gayashiva, last access: August 1, 2022).

Insights from this research could contribute to efforts to better estimate the future potential of AIRs for
climate change adaptation and mitigation under multiple plausible future climatic, demographic, economic, and
land use scenarios. 

\subsection{Model development}

The COSISTUPA model developed in section \ref{sec:Cosistupa} should be used for future estimations for AIR volume. This model
needs to be extended so that it can account for future climate variability and produce accurate meltwater
predictions. Modelling the future is fundamentally different from simulating the past: In the past the model
serves as a tool for interpreting and best exploiting field measurements - and can be directly constrained by
these. Models for the future must understand climate variability to be able to yield realistic projections.
Almost all methodological steps in the modelling of future AIR runoff are subject to possible enhancements,
always bearing in mind that we will only know whether the effort led to an enhanced or even a worsened
performance, when we're old...

\subsection{Quantification and development of ice terraces}

Although this thesis focuses on ice stupas, their ice volumes pale in comparison with ice terraces
\citep{nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}. This is because ice stupas are limited by their fountain's
spray radius. However, ice terraces have no such limitations. Their thickness is only limited by the water
supply rate or meteorological conditions and they can occupy any construction area provided. But despite this, ice
stupas are the preferred method of ice harvesting due to their longer survival duration and reduced construction
effort.

With a suitable redesign of the automation hardware, automated construction strategies can also be applied on
ice terraces. Such a construction strategy can potentially compound their size every consecutive winter with
minimal maintenance requirements. Therefore, future research direction should aim to answer the following
questions:

\begin{itemize}

  \item How can ice terrace construction systems be engineered to reduce their water losses and maintenance
    efforts?

\end{itemize}

The methodology developed in this thesis should also apply for such an analysis.

\subsection{Quantifying sustenance of glacierized catchments with AIRs}

Glaciers provide an important buffer for highly seasonal precipitation regimes
\citep{kaserContributionPotentialGlaciers2010}. Under the currently available climate change projections it is
expected that glacial mass loss will continue in future decades, and that several smaller glaciers will continue
to disappear completely \citep{rabatelCurrentStateGlaciers2013}. 

In arid and semiarid regions, in particular, it is estimated that between 50 \% and 90 \% of freshwater
resources originate from mountain catchments \citep{messerliMountainsWorldVulnerable2004}. During drought
conditions in the tropical mountain regions, glacial meltwater is used by upto 3.92 million domestic users and
to irrigate 2096 $km^2$ of land \citep{buytaertGlacialMeltContent2017}.  

These trends stress the importance of increased water storage capacity for glacierized catchments as a pathway
for climate adaptation. Because of the challenges and cost related to traditional storage efforts, AIRs can be
a better tool to adapt against reduced glacial runoff. In order to quantify their adaptation potential, it
is necessary to understand the changing dynamics of AIR melting, but also map how their meltwater contributes to
current and future water use. While the spatiotemporal dynamics of AIR melt are increasingly well understood and
documented in this thesis, major uncertainty remains on how their meltwater contribution propagates through the
hydrological system and compares against the total discharge of mountain catchments. 

Future research needs to determine which catchments can benefit most from the supplementary water supply
provided by these ice harvesting technologies and flag off the urgent climate action required to increase their
water security.

% Our findings are essential to design nature-based solutions that increase the reliability of water supply in
% highly seasonal and arid environments and improve water security and climate change adaptation in mountain
% regions.

% Irrigation networks in arid mountain regions are completely dependant on the timely availability of meltwater
% from glaciers, snow and permafrost. With the accelerated decline of glaciers, these irrigation networks can no
% longer deliver adequate water to sustain agricultural output and take advantage of the complete growing season.
% As a consequence, some mountain villages have either been abandoned or lie on the brink of desertification
% \citep{grossmanHimalayanGlaciersMelt2015}.
