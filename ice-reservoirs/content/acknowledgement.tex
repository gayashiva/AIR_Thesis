A Ph.D., in which you have to do a research project, is a daunting task. How could I possibly frame the
questions that would lead to significant discoveries; design and interpret an experiment so that the conclusions
were absolutely convincing; foresee difficulties and see ways around them, or, failing that, solve them when
they occurred? I remember the day 

If it wasn't for my 3-year long immersion with the mountain community, I would never have had the
perseverance and commitment necessary to see through this journey.

A PhD thesis does not write itself, nor does its author operate from a deserted island. As such, I would like to
acknowledge the many individuals that contributed to the realization of this work in, what will most likely be,
one of the most read sections of this thesis. This work would not have been possible without the support,
collaboration and friendship of my family, friends and colleagues during the past 4 years. To that end, I
attempted to thank all of them in the following paragraphs.

First and foremost, words cannot express my gratitude and appreciation for professor Martin Hoelzle, my mentor.
You initiated and guided me through the wondrous world of science, at every step giving me that exta push to
believe in myself. I am grateful for the entire journey; from writing PhD proposals to suffering through the
destructive feedbacks together, from designing experiments on the blackboard to establishing Swiss and Indian
icestupa laboratories, from mere equations to real insights, to today, almost holding my PhD.

My Ph.D. project was somewhat interdisciplinary and, for a while, whenever I ran into a problem,
I pestered the faculty in my department who were experts in the various disciplines that I needed. I remember
the day when Henry Taube (who won the Nobel Prize two years later) told me he didn't know how to solve the
problem I was having in his area. I was a third-year graduate student and I figured that Taube knew about 1000
times more than I did (conservative estimate). If he didn't have the answer, nobody did.

That's when it hit me: nobody did. That's why it was a research problem. And being my research problem, it was
up to me to solve. Once I faced that fact, I solved the problem in a couple of days. (It wasn't really very
hard; I just had to try a few things.) The crucial lesson was that the scope of things I didn't know wasn't
merely vast; it was, for all practical purposes, infinite. That realization, instead of being discouraging, was
liberating. If our ignorance is infinite, the only possible course of action is to muddle through as best we
can.

Well, to say this was my thesis would be totally untrue. At best, this was my dream. THere are people in this
world, some of them so wonderful, that made this dream become a product that you are looking at. I would like to
thank all of them, and in particular:
