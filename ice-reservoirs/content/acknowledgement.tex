A PhD thesis does not write itself, nor does its author operate from a deserted island. As such, I would like to
acknowledge the many individuals that contributed to the realization of this work in, what will most likely be,
one of the most read sections of this thesis. This work would not have been possible without the support,
collaboration and friendship of my family, friends and colleagues during the past 4 years. To that end, I
attempted to thank all of them in the following paragraphs.

First and foremost, words cannot express my gratitude and appreciation for professor Martin Hoelzle, my mentor.
You initiated and guided me through the wondrous world of science, at every step giving me that exta push to
believe in myself. I am grateful for the entire journey; from writing PhD proposals to suffering through the
destructive feedbacks together, from designing experiments on the blackboard to establishing Swiss and Indian
icestupa laboratories, from mere equations to real insights, to today, almost holding my PhD.
