By my signature, I certify that I personally wrote the thesis titled “Sustaining glacial-fed catchments with artificial ice reservoirs” without unauthorized outside help, that I only used authorized sources and means, and that I mentioned the quotations and paraphrases as such. This thesis has not already been presented to another faculty. I am aware that criminal scientific behavior according to the directives of the University of Fribourg is sanctioned.
