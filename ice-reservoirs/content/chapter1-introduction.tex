\section{Introduction}

Cryosphere-fed irrigation networks in arid mountain regions are completely dependent on the timely availability
of meltwater from glaciers, snow and permafrost \citep{immerzeelImportanceVulnerabilityWorld2020,
farhanHydrologicalRegimesConjunction2015, tveitenGlacierGrowingLocal2007}. With the accelerated decline of
glaciers due to climate change \citep{nusserLocalKnowledgeGlobal2016}, these regions are experiencing water
scarcity \citep{norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015, mukhopadhyayReevaluationSnowmeltGlacial2015}. Further, the
unreliability and the foreseen decrease of seasonal snow cover \citep{chevuturiClimateChangeLeh2018} increase
the precariousness of the water storage function of the cryosphere, especially in spring.

For example, due to the short growing period, central Ladakh is a single-cropping area with barley and wheat as
important staples, complemented by vegetables, pulses, and oil seeds
\citep{nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}. Depending on altitudinal position, irrigation with complete
flooding of fields (approximately 2-5 cm water column) starts between March and April prior to the melting of
high-altitude glaciers ( Fig. \ref{fig:irrigation_cycles}). This results in increased demand during a period of
reduced supply at the onset of the agricultural season ( Fig. \ref{fig:irrigation_cycles}).

To cope with this recurrent water scarcity, villagers have developed two types of artificial ice reservoirs
(AIRs): ice stupas and ice terraces ( Fig. \ref{fig:AIRforms}). Both the ice reservoirs capture water in the
autumn and winter, allowing it to freeze, and hold it until spring, when it melts and flows down to the fields
\citep{ipccChapterHighMountain2019, vinceGlacierMan2009, clouseLadakhArtificialGlaciers2017,
nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}. In this way, they retain a previously unused portion of the annual
flow and facilitate its use to supplement the decreased flow in the next spring ( Fig.
\ref{fig:irrigation_cycles}).

There is a long tradition of developing such ice harvesting structures in the upper Indus Basin, in both Ladakh,
northern India \citep{labbalTraditionalOasesLadakh2000, nusserIrrigationDevelopmentUpper2012} and various
locations in northern Pakistan \citep{kreutzmannScarcityOpulenceWater2011}. According to oral history and Corona
imagery from 1969, the first ice terraces are older than 50 years. Over the past decade, several ice stupas have been built to supplement the irrigation water supply of mountain
villages in India \citep{wangchukIceStupaCompetition2020, palmerStoringFrozenWater2022,
aggarwalAdaptationClimateChange2021}, Kyrgyzstan \citep{bbcnewsBrightArtificialGlacier2020}, and Chile
\citep{reutersConservationistsChileAim2021}.


Despite this widespread adoption, only a few publications examine the role of AIRs in the water resource
management in these regions. Notably, none of these prior reports have investigated AIRs outside Ladakh.
Moreover, quantifications of water storage capacity of AIRs in Ladakh vary widely between these studies
\citep{norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015, baglaArtificialGlaciersHelp1998}.

Quantifying the water storage capacity of AIRs is not straightforward since the processes by which AIRs are
formed are complex. These processes are controlled by local topography, meteorology and the construction
strategies used. Modelling approaches to quantify these processes exist on glacier surfaces but they are not
readily applicable for AIRs due to their limited size, and comparatively more variable surface area. Therefore,
further modification of glacial modelling approaches are required for them to be sensitive to the
spatio-temporal scale of AIR surface processes. Furthermore, these modelling approaches need to be validated and
calibrated with comprehensive data from in-situ field measurements. 

A spirit of improvisation guides the construction strategies of AIRs \citep{clouseLadakhArtificialGlaciers2017}.
Depending on the topography of the construction location and how water is supplied, AIRs can form as flat sheets
or vertical cones. This has resulted in ice reservoirs exhibiting significant volume variations despite
experiencing similar meteorological conditions. For example, ice terraces have attained volumes upto 30 times
larger than ice stupas built in Ladakh, India \citep{nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}. However, the
processes driving these differences can only be understood if the complete methodology behind the construction
strategy used is available.

This thesis aims to fulfill both of these requirements by providing a new set of AIR-specific volume and area
measurements via drone flights, along with meteorological data during the construction period. All these
datasets were generated through construction strategies that used fountain systems. These systems are quantified via in-situ
observations of the fountain characteristics and discharge rate measurements. First, this thesis
formulates a one-dimensional AIR model in order to calibrate and validate it with the procured AIR datasets.
Second, the thesis uses this model as a tool to propose a construction strategy that can produce AIRs
efficiently and effortlessly. It is important to note that while this thesis reviews published AIR research and
presents a comprehensive quantitative study of their water storage potential, we acknowledge that the farming
communities building these structures since mid-1800s hold substantial additional knowledge.


\section{Nomenclature and Classification}

While the term "artificial glacier" is more commonly used, we deliberately use the term "ice reservoir" in this
thesis. By definition, all glaciers, including the smallest ones, are bodies of sedimentary ice which were built
up by progressive snow compaction and firnification and flow downhill under the influence of gravity
\citep{benndouglasiGlaciersGlaciation2014}. Hence, because of their genesis and composition, AIRs differ from
glaciers. Man-made ice structures typically have a lifetime in the order of months and a size million times
smaller than typical glaciers. Therefore, any comparison between these ice structures can be misleading. Since
glaciers are considered as natural ice reservoirs, we use the terminology artificial ice reservoirs (AIRs) to
distinguish the man-made ice structures described in this thesis from the natural ones. 

% This is because it conveys the character and function of these structures more accurately
% \citep{nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}. 

However, when classified in terms of size and survival duration, AIRs exhibit similar characterestics to
very small glaciers. The glossary of glacier mass balance and related terms by
\citet{cogleyGlossaryGlacierMass2010} defines very small glaciers or glacierets as follows:

\begin{thesis_quotation}
  A very small glacier, typically less than 0.25 $km^2$ in extent, with no marked flow pattern
  visible at the surface. To qualify as a glacieret, an ice body must persist for at least two consecutive
  years. Glacierets can be of any shape, and usually occupy sheltered parts of the landscape. Windborne snow and
  avalanches can be dominant contributors to the accumulation of glacierets.
\end{thesis_quotation}

This rather broad definition of glacierets or very small glaciers may be the one best suited for AIRs since
they have been measured with areas as high as 0.15 $km^2$ and observed to last beyond a year.

As has been noted above, a spirit of improvisation guides the construction strategy of AIRs challenging their
classification. However, it has been found that construction strategies that use fountain systems form conical
AIRs, while those that don't form flat sheets of ice. Therefore, this thesis classifies all the AIRs produced
based on whether or not they use fountain systems. AIRs using fountain systems are called "ice stupas" and those
without are called "ice terraces" as this terminology denotes the resulting shape of the respective AIRs
appropriately.

\section{Objectives}

We applied an integrated approach for this study, including field measurements and modelling, to answer the
following research questions: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item What is the influence of construction location and fountain characteristics on AIR volume evolution? 

\item How can ice stupa fountain systems be engineered to reduce water loss and maintenance efforts of AIRs?

\end{enumerate}

An energy and mass balance model for artificial ice reservoirs was set up to answer the first research question
(paper I and III). Since in-situ measurements were required to run this model, we executed a measurement campaign
in Switzerland and India during the past 4 winters. These datasets provided the necessary input, calibration and
validation data to model the evolution of AIRs and study their sensitivity to meteorological conditions and
fountain characteristics (paper II). 

We also developed new construction strategies to answer the second research question. These construction
strategies employed fountains whose discharge rate was regulated by an automation system that used the AIR model
developed before. Their advantages over traditional construction strategies are quantified in paper II.

\section{Structure}

Chapter 1 introduces the motivation of this work and provides a summary of the state of knowledge about AIRs
prior to this thesis. Chapter 2 describes the origins of this technology as a religious practice. Chapter 3
gives an overview about the study sites and introduces the different field techniques applied. The engineering
design of AIR technologies are showcased in Chapter 4 along with suggestions for their improvement. The observed
spatio-temporal variations in AIR volume evolution are presented in Chapter 5 along with suggestions for
choosing future construction locations. Chapter 6 concludes the thesis with a synthesis and the future scope of
this work. Papers I, II and III are included in the Appendix.

% Over the past 30 years, 14 ice terraces have
% been constructed in central Ladakh, located in tributary valleys of the Indus
% \citep{norphelArtificialGlacierHigh2009, nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}. Chewang Norphel, a well
% known engineer of the Leh Nutrition Project, introduced this practice to Ladakh \citep{vinceGlacierMan2009}.

% Ice stupas were invented by Sonam Wangchuk in 2013 \citep{wangchukIceStupaArtificial2014} to provide a much
% cheaper alternative to achieve water storage compared to ice terraces. Ice stupas can also be placed much closer
% to the plantations since they absorb lesser solar radiation per unit volume compared to ice terraces due to
% their conical shape. However, the typical volume range of ice stupas ( Fig. \ref{fig:airs_ladakh}) are also
% much smaller than ice terraces. Over the past decade, several ice stupas have been built to supplement
% irrigation water supply of mountain villages in India \citep{wangchukIceStupaCompetition2020,
% palmerStoringFrozenWater2022, aggarwalAdaptationClimateChange2021}, Kyrgyzstan
% \citep{bbcnewsBrightArtificialGlacier2020} and Chile \citep{reutersConservationistsChileAim2021}.
